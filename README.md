# Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This analysis provides insights into the sales trends and relationships between units sold and total profit for various item types. The analysis includes:
1. Linear regression to establish the relationship between units sold and total profit for each item type.
2. Sales trends analyzed month-wise, year-wise, and yearly month-wise.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- Region
- Country
- Item Type
- Sales Channel
- Order Priority
- Order Date
- Order ID
- Ship Date
- Units Sold
- Unit Price
- Unit Cost
- Total Revenue
- Total Cost
- Total Profit

## Analysis Details

### Linear Regression
Linear regression was performed to establish the relationship between units sold and total profit (in thousands) for each item type. The coefficients of the regression model for each item type are as follows:
- **Baby Food:** Slope = 0.096
- **Cereal:** Slope = 0.089
- **Office Supplies:** Slope = 0.126
- **Fruits:** Slope = 0.0024
- **Household:** Slope = 0.166
- **Vegetables:** Slope = 0.063
- **Personal Care:** Slope = 0.025
- **Clothes:** Slope = 0.073
- **Cosmetics:** Slope = 0.174
- **Beverages:** Slope = 0.016
- **Meat:** Slope = 0.057
- **Snacks:** Slope = 0.055

### Sales Trends
The sales trends were analyzed in three ways:
1. **Month-wise Trend:** Total revenue calculated for each month.
2. **Year-wise Trend:** Total revenue calculated for each year.
3. **Yearly Month-wise Trend:** Total revenue calculated for each month of each year.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes visualizations for the following:
1. **Linear Regression:** Scatter plots with regression lines showing the relationship between units sold and total profit (in thousands) for each item type.
2. **Sales Trends:**
   - Month-wise Sales Trend
   - Year-wise Sales Trend
   - Yearly Month-wise Sales Trend

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn`.
2. Load the dataset and perform the analysis as described.
3. Visualize the results using the provided code for generating plots.

## Conclusion
This analysis helps in understanding the sales performance and profitability of different item types over various time periods. It provides valuable insights for decision-making and strategic planning.
